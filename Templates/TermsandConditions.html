Images of products and packaging on the Online Services are simply examples, and the product or package you receive from a Cafe may differ. Differences in color presentation may be related to your device's display of colors or to factors such as the ingredients used, the suppliers, the country's area, and the season.</h8><br>
<br>
<h8>The items are being ordered. Orders placed through the Online Services will be assigned to the Cafe  closest to your area. However, KGD Cafe maintains the right, for any reason, to modify the Cafe allocated to fulfill your requests.</h8><br>

<br>
<h8>Order cancellations, modifications, and refunds are all possible. You may phone 09770120167 or your local delivery number to change or cancel your purchase before to delivery.

Both cash and cashless transactions are covered under this policy.</h8><br>
<br>
<h8>In the case of cashless transactions, you understand and agree that if your request for a cancellation or change does not comply with the above-mentioned rules, the full value of the product bought will be charged to your account. You also acknowledge and agree that the same policy will apply if you refuse to accept any product delivery.</h8><br>
<br>
<h8>You may contact us by phone at 09770120167 or by email at appey 30@yahoo.com to seek a refund.

The merchandise delivered must be returned to the Cafe in its original packaging, unless the order was not received.</h8><br>
<br>
<h8>The refund amount will be credited back to the account used in the original transaction for transactions paid by cashless means of payment, and may be subject to separate processing requirements (including processing time) of your issuing bank or third party provider. Fees and levies that are applicable may be subtracted from the total amount.</h8><br>
<br>
<h8>If you are unhappy with your order, please call 09770120167 or email appey 30@yahoo.com with your issues.</h8><br>
<br>
<h8>Timely delivery is guaranteed. The delivery time is determined by the agreed-upon synchronization time between you and our KGD Delivery agents. The Philippine Standard Time, which can be found at www.dost.gov.ph and asia.pool.ntp.org, is the official time.
